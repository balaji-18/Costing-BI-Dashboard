	3.	Ownership Accountability:
	•	The “AV Count by Owner” section assigns AV responsibilities to specific team members, improving accountability and helping managers identify high and low performers. This data can aid in workload distribution and resource allocation.
	4.	Category-wise Breakdown:
	•	The “AV Count By Category” donut chart visualizes counts across various components (e.g., Display, Application Software, Memory), allowing the team to assess and manage inventory based on category-specific needs and demand.
	5.	Business Segment Analysis:
	•	The “Business” pie chart provides insights into AV distribution across different business types (e.g., Desktop Commercial, Notebook Consumer), supporting strategic planning and forecasting. This helps to align resources with high-demand segments.
	6.	Lead Time and Aging Analysis:
	•	The dashboard includes filters by aging period (e.g., > 120 Days, 0-4 Weeks, etc.), helping stakeholders prioritize older items to reduce inventory holding costs and improve turnover.
	7.	User-Friendly Filters:
	•	The system includes interactive filters (e.g., System Costed In, GA in Future/Past, Year, Month), allowing users to quickly customize views and obtain specific data insights. This enhances efficiency and supports data-driven decision-making.
